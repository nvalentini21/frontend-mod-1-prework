## Section 2 Reflection

**1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**

Knowing myself, I definitely would say that one of my weaknesses is waiting to ask a question for too long, mainly because I want to try to figure it out myself. That being said, I do see the value in asking a question right away, particularly if we are in a lesson, and the subjects being covered during the lesson are built upon one another. If I get lost and don't ask a question soon enough, I'll just continue to be lost.

**2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

I appreciated that we weren't given explicit direction, especially for things that we should have ample practice on (e.g. the node directions). This helped me to really solidify commands/code into my brain so that I don't have to keep referring to something. Additionally, I liked the aspect of exploring resources and learning how to figure out the exercises on my own, as this also helps solidify the concept more quickly. The one thing I found uncomfortable with that style is perhaps wondering if I researched/learned enough about the concept, and if maybe we were supposed to go into more depth. I can find myself falling into the trap of just researching enough to answer the questions, but not really going any further or jumping down the rabbit hole of why those things work, especially under time pressure.

**3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

A conditional statement, is a statement that tells a computer to do one thing or another. It is usually checked through if statements. Conditionals are used on social media platforms, e.g. when you input your age, there will probably be a conditional that tailors content/advertisements to you based on if you are greater than or equal to 18.

**4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

When writing an if statement, you specify the first conditional. The computer will read this as, 'if the first conditional is true, then I will run the following block of code.' To add other conditionals, the term else is used, and if the first conditional was not satisfied, the computer will move onto the next conditional indicated my else. It will then determine if this statement is true, and if so will run the code that follows. Lastly, else if can be used to check the opposite of a previously defined conditional; e.g. if the conditional asked for something to be true, this would provide a code that would be run if the conditional were false.

**5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**

If you want to check that two conditions are met, or true, a logical operator can be used; for instance `&&`. This operator will make sure that the two conditions are both met before running a block of code.

**6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**

Regarding functions, not so much a specific question, but more clarification/examples on how to use multiple parameters or multiple arguments. I'm still a little iffy on the difference between parameters and arguments; to me it seems that parameters just the title for the actual arguments themselves, and the arguments contain the actual data. Not sure if this is a specific enough understanding?
