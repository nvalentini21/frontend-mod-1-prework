## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  - I have never heard of the SMART acronym before: Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals, but it makes complete sense in terms of breaking down projects so that they can be completed in an efficient and proficient manner. Futhermore, I like the idea of reflecting on projects to figure out what worked, what didnt, as this is a crucial part of moving forward.
  - Seeking out challeneges and pushing oneself outside of the boundaries is a huge part of a growth mindset, in addition to being ok asking for help on things.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - I feel that I demonstrate a growth mindset in that I am wiling to learn and put in the time it takes to practice code. I love reading about new concepts, and if I need to read material outside of the curriculum in order for me to better understand something, I usually will.
  - An area that I can improve on regarding the growth mindset is asking for help when stuck, or being fine making mistakes here or there. I tend to be on the introverted side, or think that I can figure something out myself (which should always be tried first), but at the end of the day sometimes it will be more efficient to ask for outside input.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Spotify is an application I use frequently that makes use of arrays. In particular, you can organize different songs into playlists, which is essentially creating an array of specific songs you want to listen to. Additionally, spotify has premade 'arrays' that separate music by different categories.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is basically a specific function that can be performed on an array to alter certain properties/values in an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is used to check a condtion for multiple interations, as needed. With an array, a loop can be used to perform a function to every value in the array. Outside of an array, loops can be used to build upon a previous value and return the next increment.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would tell a five year old that a loop is essentially doing the same exact thing over and over to many items. For example, if you had a bunch of presents, each present would have to be wrapped. When you go to wrap each present, you are performing the same loop to every present over and over again.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'm curious as to how loops can be used over arrays if the values in the array are not the same variable times, e.g. strings mixed with booleans and numbers.
