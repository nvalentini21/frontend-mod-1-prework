## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  - Overall, I felt like my workflow was more productive and more efficient. I also found that it helped me significantly too step away and take breaks for 5-10 minutes, especially if I encountered a coding problem that I was stuck on. Furthermore, the technique actually helped to keep me on schedule.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  - Setting intentions definitely kept me on track more, as I had a general layout of how long everything would take me. I found that I was more productive this way. What surprised me is that I set aside a lot more time than I thought I would need to complete tasks (which in essence is a good thing), and so it left me a lot more time to dig more deeply into learning more about a specific subject/task. Furthermore, I found that I took breaks more often, but that they were shorter, and this really helped keep me from working for too long of a time and then taking an extended break. Overall I felt more productive.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  - An object is a collection of multiple variables and functions that all share a commonality, and would allow you to model something from the real world. This is different from an array, which is a collection of variables alone and not functions.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - array: a simple list with names is all that is needed here.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - an object would be better, since you will have a state that can have many properties associated with it (such as capital).
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - array: simple list of things to pack will suffice as you don't need to break those items down further.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - array: a simple array of the accounts that can be added too or subtracted from.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - array: also a simple array of names that can be added or subtracted, no other properties or methods need to be performed.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - object: The cake would have many different ingredients and methods that need to be completed to bake.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - array: once again, a simple list/array of the restaurants names that can be added too/subtracted from with array methods will suffice; no other complex methods need to be performed.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

On the United App, an object could potentially be a flight. The flight would have keys such as the flight number, flight model, flight destination, number of seats booked, payment transaction, number of people checked in, etc. and the associated values that would be strings (e.g. for destination) or numbers (e.g. for number of seats booked).

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
When is it better to have a class over an object? It seems like they are both able to incorporate variables and functions - why use one over the other?
