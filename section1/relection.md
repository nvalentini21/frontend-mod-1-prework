## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  The SuperLearner Article resonated with me because it relates to what I feel about becoming a good learner: anyone can do it. In terms of the list, I already really enjoy reading about new topics. I do feel I should start doing more of teaching others what I know, in the form of participating more in class, answering as many questions in the slack as possible, and being engaged with my teammates.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  - number: all numbers, decimals, negative numbers.
  - string: characters written in quotations.
  - boolean: evaluated as true or false.



3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Two backslashes are used to indicate comments; the purpose of any text that follows the backslashes is to provide notes for anyone reading the code, without that section of the code actually being read/processed by the program.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is used to store a value that can be used for later. If explaining to a five year old: I would say that it is like give a word or letter a meaning, and once given that meaning, that meaning sticks with it until it is changed.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Facebook:
 - Strings are used in comments or descriptions of photos. e.g. var name = Nicole.
 - Numbers are used when providing dates or ages. e.g. var age = 29
 - booleans may be used in terms of age. If the user inputs an age greater than 18, the true evaluation will lead to alcohol adds being shown on the facebook page.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining together of two strings or variables using a plus sign.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Facebook is yet another example; when filling out a profile, you enter strings of information such as name, location, description. The name that is input can be used as a concatenation with other phrases that facebook will output to you and the public.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm still not entirely sure if my real life examples for variables and concatenation is legitimate? I'd like to hear about more examples of those in actual websites to clarify my understanding of them.
